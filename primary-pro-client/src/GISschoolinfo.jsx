          WHO WE ARE <br />
          Ghana International School is a not-for-profit, private,
          non-sectarian, coeducational day school established in September 1955
          to provide international education to students of all races and
          creeds, at a time when Ghana was yet to achieve full independence, and
          international schools were a rarity. Sixty years on, GIS continues to
          provide quality education to both international and local students in
          a completely different and more competitive educational settin
          <br />
          <br />
          WHAT WE OFFER <br />
          GIS offers a curriculum modeled along the English National Curriculum
          and Cambridge International Examinations, IGCSE and GCE Advanced level
          with English language as the medium of instruction. Ghana
          International School after years of application and hard work is the
          first and only international school in Ghana to be accredited by both
          the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the New England
          Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). The school is also an
          active member of the Association of International Schools in Africa
          (AISA).
